# This is clone repository of PyCDXML

`pycdxml` package contains several modules to support working with `cdxml`and `cdx`file formats used by ChemDraw in an automated, platform-independent way. The package works without needing to have ChemDraw installed and also on non-windows systems (untested but no reason it should not work, pure python).

Here is the link to orifginal repo developed by Joos Kiener: https://github.com/kienerj/pycdxml. Please refer the original repo for more recent releases and code fixes.
