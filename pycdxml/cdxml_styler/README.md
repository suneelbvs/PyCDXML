# CDXMLStyler

## Introduction

CDXMLStyler is a module to programmatically adjust the style of all the molecules contained in a `cdxml` file to the desired ChemDraw style. The style changes are limited to what affects the display of small molecules like bond length or atom label font size.

`cdxml` is the xml-based format of ChemDraw. This style-conversion can be achieved with ChemDraw itself but not in an automated fashion. Therefore the main purpose of the tool is batch conversion of  multiple`cdxml` files to the same style either for normalization in a database or for usage in the same ChemDraw file (see also CDXML Slide Generator module).

The styling will often require translating the molecule. In case the document contains additional drawing elements that may or may not be related to the molecule like brackets these might not be translated at all or not entirely correctly. Also distances between molecules might change in relative and absolute terms.

## Usage

`CDXMLStyler`class can be instantiated either by an included named style ( currently limited to ACS 1996 or Wiley), a template `cdxml`file or from a `dict` containing the required style options.

Named Style:

```python
styler = CDXMLStyler(style_name="ACS 1996")
cdxml_normalized = self.styler.apply_style_to_string(cdxml)
```
Currently only ACS 1996 and Wiley styles are supported.

From `cdxml` template:

```python
styler = CDXMLStyler(style_source="path/to/style.cdxml")
cdxml_normalized = self.styler.apply_style_to_string(cdxml)
```

From a `dict`:

```python
styler = CDXMLStyler(style_dict=style_dict)
cdxml_normalized = self.styler.apply_style_to_string(cdxml)
```

The required style options for using a `dict`input are:

- `BondSpacing`
- `BondLength`
- `BoldWidth`
- `LineWidth`
- `MarginWidth`
- `HashSpacing`
- `CaptionSize`
- `LabelSize`
- `LabelFace`
- `LabelFont`
- `HideImplicitHydrogens`

Note that `LabelFont`Â must be a valid font name available on the system. This is not verified! `HideImplicitHydrogens`is relevant because some styles have it set to `yes` meaning that say an alcohol is displayed as `O` and not `OH`.  Therefore when this setting changes from old to new style, the atom label needs to be adjusted accordingly.
